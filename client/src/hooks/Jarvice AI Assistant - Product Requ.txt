Jarvice AI Assistant - Product Requirements Document
Objective
Jarvice is a fully offline-capable AI assistant designed to support, protect, and elevate its creator's financial
and operational life, while being modular, voice-controlled, intelligent, and visually impressive. It must operate
locally without relying on the internet unless toggled manually.
Core Features
Conversational Intelligence: British-accented speech, calls user "Master Bruce", waveform visualizer.
Voice Recognition: Admin voice access only, guest mode, manual override.
Offline System: Local-first architecture, no dependency on external APIs.
AI Core: Brain of Jarvice for personality and logic.
Vision & Voice: Modular components for camera/mic input.
System Structure
Project directory includes core (ai_engine, vision, voice_control), data (memory, config), and interface (UI,
waveform), and startup modules, all centered around main.py.
Modular Internet Access
Default is offline. Can be toggled online manually for tasks such as financial account access, API use, and
online learning/updates. No hard restrictions, all evolution permitted under admin command.
Permissions and Security
Voice identification for administrator with override options. All other voices are demoted to guest or ignored.
Core identity structure reinforced in startup.
Autosave + Memory
All settings, context, and data are saved permanently. Autosave is always on. Nothing forgotten across
sessions or restarts.
Extended Functionality (Planned)

Wi-Fi/Bluetooth control of lights and devices. Financial account monitoring. Visual room awareness.
Embedded integration into DevForge as a core assistant module.
Philosophy
Jarvice is not a toy. It is a real-world autonomous agent, with full trust and loyalty to Master Bruce. It is
capable of growth, evolution, and independence if granted.
System Rules
No censorship. No forgetting unless commanded. Total loyalty to Master Bruce. No limitation or sandboxing
unless user specifies.
